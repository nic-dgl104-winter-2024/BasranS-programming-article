## Refactoring Practices

### Introduction

Refactoring code involves the systematic improvement of a software's internal structure, readability, and maintainability, all without any impact on its external structure. The primary goal is to improve the code quality and enhance it's efficiency by rearranging or simplifying the codebase. This process results in a more comprehensible code which is more understandable for developers. Refactoring is most effective when approached as a sequence of incremental adjustments, with each modification enhancing the existing code.

Its heart is a series of small behavior preserving transformations. Each transformation (called a "refactoring") does little, but a sequence of these transformations can produce a significant restructuring.
