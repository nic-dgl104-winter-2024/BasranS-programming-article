## Refactoring Practices

### Introduction

Refactoring code involves systematically improving a software's internal structure, readability, and maintainability, all without any impact on its external structure. The primary goal is to improve the code quality and enhance its efficiency by rearranging or simplifying the codebase. This process results in a more comprehensible code which is more understandable for developers. Refactoring is most effective when approached as a sequence of incremental adjustments, with each modification enhancing the existing code.

Its heart is a series of small behavior-preserving transformations. Each transformation (called a "refactoring") does little, but a sequence of these transformations can produce a significant restructuring. 
(Martin Fowler, 1997-1999). Refactoring.com. https://refactoring.com/

### Why should you refactor the code?

Code refactoring is essential to keep code clean, readable, and maintainable over time. As developers work on a codebase, natural changes can introduce inefficiencies, redundancies, and complexity if not appropriately addressed.

Some common reasons code becomes messy and requires refactoring include:

Redundant code creeps in as developers duplicate logic to solve problems quickly. This wastes time and effort in maintaining duplicate 
segments that should get consolidated.

Variables and methods accumulate that no longer serve a clear purpose. Outdated code obscures the intended functionality.

Functions and classes expand indefinitely as new requirements get added without undergoing redesign. This results in sprawling code that 
is challenging to navigate and comprehend.

Quick fixes get applied through unnecessary conditions and loops instead of taking the time for a cleaner design. This practice litters the code with clutter.

Over time, the initial design shows limitations, but lack of refactoring prevents improvement. Technical debt rises, and technical solutions become messy. (https://chisellabs.com/glossary/what-is-refactoring/)
