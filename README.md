## Refactoring Practices

### Introduction

Refactoring code involves systematically improving a software's internal structure, readability, and maintainability, all without any impact on its external structure. The primary goal is to improve the code quality and enhance its efficiency by rearranging or simplifying the codebase. This process results in a more comprehensible code which is more understandable for developers. Refactoring is most effective when approached as a sequence of incremental adjustments, with each modification enhancing the existing code.

Its heart is a series of small behavior-preserving transformations. Each transformation (called a "refactoring") does little, but a sequence of these transformations can produce a significant restructuring.

### Best Time to Refactor

The best time to consider refactoring is before adding any updates or new features to existing code. Going back and cleaning up the current code before adding in new programming will not only improve the quality of the product itself, it will make it easier for future developers to build on the original code.

Another time to think about refactoring is right after you’ve delivered a product to market. Yes, that sounds ridiculous. You’ve finally launched a product you’ve been working on for months, maybe even years, and now you have to go back to the beginning? This is actually the perfect time to do a little housekeeping, as chances are developers now have more availability to work on refactoring before moving on to the next job.(https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/code-refactoring-best-practices-when-and-when-not-to-do-it/)

### Why should you refactor the code?

Code refactoring is essential to keep code clean, readable, and maintainable over time. As developers work on a codebase, natural changes can introduce inefficiencies, redundancies, and complexity if not appropriately addressed.

Some common reasons code becomes messy and requires refactoring include:

* Improved code quality
* Increased maintainability
* Better performance
* Lower risk of bugs
* Higher developer productivity
