## Refactoring Practices

### Introduction

Refactoring code involves systematically improving a software's internal structure, readability, and maintainability, all without any impact on its external structure. The primary goal is to improve the code quality and enhance its efficiency by rearranging or simplifying the codebase. This process results in a more comprehensible code which is more understandable for developers. Refactoring is most effective when approached as a sequence of incremental adjustments, with each modification enhancing the existing code.

Its heart is a series of small behavior-preserving transformations. Each transformation (called a "refactoring") does little, but a sequence of these transformations can produce a significant restructuring. 
(Martin Fowler, 1997-1999). Refactoring.com. https://refactoring.com/

### Best Time to Refactor

The best time to consider refactoring is before adding any updates or new features to existing code. Going back and cleaning up the current code before adding in new programming will not only improve the quality of the product itself, it will make it easier for future developers to build on the original code.

Another time to think about refactoring is right after you’ve delivered a product to market. Yes, that sounds ridiculous. You’ve finally launched a product you’ve been working on for months, maybe even years, and now you have to go back to the beginning? This is actually the perfect time to do a little housekeeping, as chances are developers now have more availability to work on refactoring before moving on to the next job.(https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/code-refactoring-best-practices-when-and-when-not-to-do-it/)

### Why should you refactor the code?

Code refactoring is essential to keep code clean, readable, and maintainable over time. As developers work on a codebase, natural changes can introduce inefficiencies, redundancies, and complexity if not appropriately addressed.

Some common reasons code becomes messy and requires refactoring include:

* Improved code quality
* Increased maintainability
* Better performance
* Lower risk of bugs
* Higher developer productivity

### Refactoring Best Practices 

These proven strategies help ensure refactoring success and mitigate any potential risks involved in the process.

1. Refactor first before adding any new features
This practice ensures the codebase is in the best possible state to accommodate new additions. Instagram’s development team followed this approach before introducing their IGTV feature, helping to prevent feature creep and maintain a clean, manageable codebase.

2. Planning your refactoring project and timeline carefully
This involves deciding what to refactor, when, and how to mitigate associated risks. Twitter, for example, carefully planned its shift from Ruby on Rails to a JVM-based stack over several years, allowing for a smooth transition without significant user-facing issues.

3. Testing often throughout the refactoring process
Testing is a crucial part of refactoring. Netflix has automated tests that run continuously throughout their refactoring process, enabling them to catch and address any regressions or issues immediately.

4. Involving your QA team in the process
The QA team plays a vital role in ensuring the refactored code meets the quality standards. Companies like Shopify involve their QA teams early to ensure thorough testing and high-quality code.

5. Focusing on progress, not perfection
Remember, refactoring is about improving the codebase incrementally, not perfecting it. Microsoft follows this principle, regularly making minor improvements to its vast codebase.

6. Trying refactoring automation
There are tools available that can automate parts of the refactoring process. Google, for instance, developed an internal tool called Rosie, which has automated millions of refactorings, improving developer productivity and code quality.

### Best Practices (Bonus tips)

1. Take incremental steps
Rather than attempting to refactor a large portion of your codebase simultaneously, taking small, incremental steps is often best. This approach makes the process more manageable and reduces the risk of introducing bugs. Amazon applies this principle by frequently deploying small but substantive changes to its codebase, leading to continuous improvement and allowing them to maintain one of the world’s most complex e-commerce platforms.

2. Keep your Code DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)
Duplication is the root of all evil in programming. DRY is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition. Applying DRY principles means that developers should aim to reduce the repetition of information of all kinds. Twitter’s development team follows this principle, which has helped to keep its codebase clean and maintainable despite its large size.

3. Use refactoring tools
Many integrated development environments (IDEs) include tools that automate refactoring tasks. This can speed up the refactoring process and help ensure you don’t introduce bugs in your code. Airbnb, for example, uses the RuboCop tool for their Ruby codebase to enforce style conventions and find common errors before they become problems.
